# Dropout

Dropout is a game that requires you to make tough choices. You're a mere circle running around in a world of loose tiles,
trying to find a place to stand until someone can come rescue you.

What you don't know is that no one is coming.

## Implementation

This game is built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), an excellent MV* framework from Google and a variety of different
plugins from the community. It is currently *single player* and can be run in a local browser.
